# HavestShare
project for KI Garage

Challenge:
Create a web app where landowners can register their fruit trees or bushes that they cannot harvest themselves (due to time, health, etc.).

Core features:

Register tree/bush location (with map)
Specify harvest period
Set harvest share (e.g. 30% owner / 70% harvester)
Rate users (reliability, cleanliness, plant care, match with description)
